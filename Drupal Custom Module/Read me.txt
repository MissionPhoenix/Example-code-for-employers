This custom module was created by copying and editing a template found 
here: https://www.flocondetoile.fr/blog/filter-content-year-views-drupal-8

This was my first real experience with the coding within the symphony framework ( or any MVC framework ) 
Feb 2020. I have gained a decent amount of Laravel experience since then.

I think I could write a Drupal Module from scratch but it would take me a while as I would have to reference the Drupal 
documentation heaviliy as I go.
